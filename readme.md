Working through the book, Functional Javascript: Introducing Functional Programming with Underscore.js.

The plan is to code out all the examples throughout the book, making changes and alterations to gain a better understanding of how it all works.

Then I'm going to recreate the functionality using the Ramda library instead of the underscore library, to cement my understanding of how all these things works, and as a good jumping point to get used to working with Ramda's syntax.
